  		<h2>IDEA</h2>
    	<p>The most significant challenge in the stock market is to predict the stock prices.
Today more and more people are interested in and are related to this sector,
which makes it essential for them to know about the market trends. Since, the
stock market is a non-parametric and a non-linear system, it is liable to quick
changes in stock prices. Our idea is to develop a model which predicts the values
of the stock of a particular company and compare it with others which with
further extensions can be used to support the consumerâ€™s trading strategies.
Furthermore, the model will also be able to suggest the user on which stock to
predict on the basis of information provided such as the amount to be invested
and expected return period.</p></center>
